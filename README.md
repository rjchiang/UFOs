# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this webpage and dynamic table is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, one will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The raw data from the Javascript array is displayed in a dynamic table where users can filter data of UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape in the filter boxes on the left side of the webpage.

## Summary

### Drawback

There is no reset button to click on, in case one needs to seek data in a new filter.

### Recommendations

* A reset button is required so no need to refresh the webpage and the table.

* May require more filters to narrow more searches
